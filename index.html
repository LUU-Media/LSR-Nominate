                Fancy being part of the team that leads the country’s biggest student radio station? Then you should run for a position on LSR’s committee. Our committee is large, with room for lots of creative ideas and people. It doesn’t matter what sort of person you are, LSR needs everyone. Whether you’re a natural leader, who wants to run a large team with socials and events, or you’re someone who wants to work behind the scenes, we need you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every year we elect our committee, and they are a crucial part of how the following year will run. This election is incredibly important for members, and for potential committee members. It’s your chance to step up to a position of responsibility in the station, and bring your best ideas to life. Is there something LSR isn’t doing well enough? Or have you got new ideas about what we should be doing? Then run for a position on committee. If you’re a member, you need to have your say about who is in charge next year. This is to ensure that each year, LSR reflects the needs and desires of its members.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only is being on committee incredibly fun, but it’s a real asset to your CV. In your time at the station, you will be able to demonstrate a number of important skills, and get access to some really exciting opportunities. You’ll also be doing something you love, with people who will become your close friends.
