# LSR-Nominate
Every year, a new committee is elected to run Leeds Student Radio. Members can nominate themselves for one of our many
committee roles, and help run the station next year. However, we have rather a lot of members (over 350), so simply
asking people to tell us that they'd like to nominate themselves would quickly become impractical. That's why this
website exists.

## Before we get started...
Please remember that this website was built specifically for LSR's needs. You are welcome to repurpose the code here for
whatever you need, but certain things, such as the myLSR connector or default Google form submission link will not work
out of the box for you.
